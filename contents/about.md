# mijnrealiteit

I'm Mike and sometimes I shoot pictures, when I do I'll try to upload them to this photoblog! Photography is a hobby and a creative outlet for me, so don't get your hopes up *to* much.

Most pictures are either taken in places where I lived (the Netherlands or Ireland) or when I was traveling (as of now, Europe and Asia).
