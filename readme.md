# Mijnrealiteit Photoblog

This is the code behind my photoblog [mijnrealiteit](https://mijnrealiteit.nl).

## How It Works

The photoblog uses a simple static site generator to generate the blog (with RSS feed) and optimize all images for web.

### Directory Structure
```
/raw_articles/
    /my-post/
        - index.md          # Markdown content with front matter
        - image1.jpg        # High-resolution images
        - image2.jpg

/build/                     # Final built website, generated by build.js
```

### Article Format
Each article is a directory with an `index.md` file:

```markdown
---
title: My Post Title
date: 2023-12-01
---

Here's my article content with **markdown** support.

![description](image1.jpg)
```

## Setup and Usage

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Build the Site
```bash
npm run build
```

This processes all markdown files and generates a complete static website in the `build/` directory.

### 3. Preview Locally
```bash
# Install http-server globally
npm install -g http-server

# Serve the build directory
http-server build
```

### 4. Deploy
```bash
./up.sh
```

This runs the full pipeline: build (image processing, website rendering) â†’ deploy.

## Image Processing

The system automatically processes images:
- High-resolution images from `raw_articles/` are resized and optimized in a few different variants (of different dimensions and web image formats)
- Images wider than 2000px are automatically resized

## File Structure

- `raw_articles/` - Source markdown files and high-res images
- `build/` - Final built website
- `build.js` - Main build script
- `static/` - Static folder for website assets

## Adding New Articles

1. Create a new directory in `raw_articles/`
2. Add `index.md` with front matter (title, date)
3. Add your images
4. Run `npm run build` to rebuild
5. Run `http-server build` to preview locally

## Configuration

Edit the `config` object in `build.js` to change:
- Site URL
- Site name
